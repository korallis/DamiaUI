TGA Header - DamiaUI 64x64 Icon Placeholder
==============================================
This is a placeholder TGA file for the DamiaUI addon icon.

Since this is a text representation, the actual TGA file would need to be created 
using image editing software with the following specifications:

Resolution: 64x64 pixels
Format: 24-bit TGA or 32-bit TGA with alpha channel
Color Profile: sRGB

Design Elements:
- Background: Dark gray (RGB: 26, 26, 26) - (r=0.1, g=0.1, b=0.1)
- Primary Element: Stylized "D" in orange (RGB: 204, 128, 26) - (r=0.8, g=0.5, b=0.1)
- Border/Accent: Medium gray (RGB: 77, 77, 77) - (r=0.3, g=0.3, b=0.3)

The "D" should be:
- Bold, modern font
- Centered in the icon
- Slightly beveled or with subtle shadow for depth
- Professional appearance suitable for addon selection screen

To create the actual TGA file:
1. Use GIMP, Photoshop, or similar image editor
2. Create 64x64 canvas with transparent background
3. Add dark background rectangle with rounded corners (2-3px radius)
4. Add stylized "D" in orange color
5. Add subtle border or glow effect in medium gray
6. Export as 24-bit TGA format
7. Convert to BLP using WoW tools or BLP converter

Note: This text file should be replaced with an actual TGA image file.
